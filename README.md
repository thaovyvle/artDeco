# Project Task:

Design a single-page website that showcases a movement in art, culture, or music. It should also demonstrate your creativity. The idea here is to make a site that feels like it belongs in a particular school of design. This means you need to think about things like color choices, spacing, images, fonts, and spacing. This is a twofold task:

• The style (CSS) should reflect that of the movement.

• The content (HTML) should explain the movement.

​

# My Approach:

I chose to develop a single-page website dedicated to the art movement: Art Deco. This website was constructed using HTML and CSS, marking my initial foray into front-end web design. While the website may not be responsive, it serves as a foundational experience in this field. I designed the logo and landing page in a manner that aligns with the Art Deco aesthetic. Additionally, I selected colors and fonts to maintain overall cohesiveness throughout the entire website.
